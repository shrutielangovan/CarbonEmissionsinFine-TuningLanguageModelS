        "# Quantifying the Environmental Cost of AI: Carbon Emissions in Language Model Fine-Tuning for Question Answering\n",
        "\n",
        "> ### **Project Goal** : As language models continue to play a larger role in natural language processing, their environmental impact has become an important issue to consider. While much of the research in this area focuses on improving model accuracy, the energy use and carbon footprint involved in training these systems are often overlooked or poorly documented. This project aims to explore that imbalance by studying how improvements in model performance relate to the environmental costs of fine-tuning."

Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".\n",
