        "# Quantifying the Environmental Cost of AI: Carbon Emissions in Language Model Fine-Tuning for Question Answering\n",
        "\n",
        "> ### **Project Goal** : As language models continue to play a larger role in natural language processing, their environmental impact has become an important issue to consider. While much of the research in this area focuses on improving model accuracy, the energy use and carbon footprint involved in training these systems are often overlooked or poorly documented. This project aims to explore that imbalance by studying how improvements in model performance relate to the environmental costs of fine-tuning.\n"
